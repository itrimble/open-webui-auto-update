echo "ðŸ“Š Current Data Status:"
echo "----------------------"
docker exec open-webui ls -lh /app/backend/data/webui.db 2>/dev/null | awk '{print "Database size: " $5 " (contains all your settings)"}'
docker exec open-webui find /app/backend/data/uploads -type f 2>/dev/null | wc -l | awk '{print "Uploaded files: " $1}'

echo "ðŸ”„ What happens during an update:"
echo "--------------------------------"
echo "1. Old container stops (app only)"
echo "2. New container starts (updated app)"
echo "3. New container connects to SAME data volume"
echo "4. Result: All your data is still there!"

echo ""
echo "ðŸ“Œ Key Point:"
echo "------------"
echo "The Docker volume 'open-webui-data' is NEVER deleted during updates."
echo "It's like updating an app on your phone - the app updates, but your data stays."

echo "ðŸŽ¯ Bottom Line:"
echo "--------------"
echo "âœ… Settings persist automatically - no action needed"
echo "âœ… Backups are just extra insurance"
echo "âœ… After update, just use Open WebUI normally"
echo "âœ… Everything will be exactly as you left it!"
